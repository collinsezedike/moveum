## About

The internet is losing its memory. Between "link rot," platform shutdowns, and the ephemeral nature of social media, digital culture is disappearing faster than we can save it. **Moveum** is a decentralized infrastructure built to stop this.

Moveum is a permissionless "living Archive" of digital artifacts with x402 gated exhibition.

## Our Core Pillars

### 1. Open Archiving: History is Free

We believe there should be no barrier to preserving culture. Moveum allows anyone to act as a digital archivist, contributing artifacts to the permanent record without technical or financial hurdles.

* **Zero-Cost Contributions:** Through **sponsored transactions**, the technical costs of uploading are covered by the protocol.
* **Global Participation:** By removing the "gas fee" barrier, we ensure that digital folk art and artifacts from every corner of the globe are captured, not just those from wealthy participants.

### 2. Curated Access: Art is Valuable

While archiving is open, the gallery experience is a premium one. Moveum utilizes a **pay-to-view model** to ensure the platform’s longevity and to maintain the prestige of the collection.

* **Sustainability:** Access fees go directly toward maintaining the decentralized infrastructure and the creative ecosystem.
* **Intentionality:** This gatekeeping mechanism ensures that the gallery remains a space for true appreciation rather than fleeting consumption.
